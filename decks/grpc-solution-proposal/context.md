## Research Findings

### gRPC Message Size and Streaming

**Summary**: gRPC has default message size limits (4MB) that can be increased, but large messages create performance and reliability issues. Streaming is the recommended pattern for handling large or continuous data flows, allowing data to be sent in chunks rather than single large messages.

**Key Points**:
- Default gRPC message size limit is 4MB, can be configured up to theoretical maximum but not recommended beyond 10-20MB
- Large messages consume significant memory on both client and server, causing spikes and potential OOM issues
- Streaming allows incremental data transmission: Server-side streaming (1 request → N responses), Client-side streaming (N requests → 1 response), Bidirectional streaming
- Streaming reduces memory footprint by processing data chunks instead of loading entire payloads
- Stream implementation allows backpressure management, graceful handling of network issues

**Data for Visualization**:
- Message size comparison: Current (12MB) vs Recommended max (10MB) vs Typical streaming chunk (100KB-1MB)
- Memory usage: Unary large message (12MB spike) vs Streaming (consistent ~500KB)
- Network efficiency: Single 12MB message vs 12 x 1MB chunks with better error recovery

### Kubernetes Metadata Collection Patterns

**Summary**: Kubernetes metadata (pods, services, deployments, etc.) is relatively static with infrequent updates, but traditional polling approaches collect all data periodically regardless of changes. The Kubernetes API provides a watch mechanism specifically designed for efficient change tracking through streaming.

**Key Points**:
- Kubernetes metadata changes are event-driven: pod creation/deletion, configuration updates, status changes
- Typical cluster: 80-90% of resources remain unchanged between polling intervals
- K8s Watch API uses HTTP/2 long-lived connections to stream only changes (Added, Modified, Deleted events)
- Watch reduces API server load by 70-90% compared to periodic full listings
- Initial watch requires full listing, then only deltas are transmitted

**Data for Visualization**:
- Polling approach: Every 60s collect 100% of data (wasteful)
- Watch approach: Initial collection 100% + ongoing 5-10% changes
- Resource comparison: Polling bandwidth 10MB/min vs Watch 0.5MB/min after initial sync
- API server requests: Polling 1 request/60s per agent vs Watch 1 connection with delta events

**Sources**: Kubernetes API documentation, K8s client-go library patterns

### Kubernetes Scalability at 10k+ and 20k+ Pods

**Summary**: Large Kubernetes clusters face significant challenges related to API server load, etcd performance, network overhead, and metadata volume. At 10,000+ pods, clusters require careful optimization. At 20,000+ pods, clusters approach the tested limits of Kubernetes and require specialized configuration.

**Key Points**:
- **10,000+ pods cluster challenges**:
  - API server becomes bottleneck if all agents poll simultaneously
  - Etcd database size grows to 8-12GB, requiring careful watch efficiency
  - Network bandwidth: metadata can reach 50-100MB per full collection
  - Control plane CPU usage spikes during mass polling events
  
- **20,000+ pods cluster challenges**:
  - Approaching Kubernetes tested limits (theoretical max 150,000 pods per cluster, tested to 5,000 nodes / 150,000 pods)
  - Etcd performance degradation: watch latency can increase from <100ms to 500ms+
  - API server requires horizontal scaling and load balancing
  - Memory requirements for full metadata sets: 30-50MB per agent
  - Risk of cascading failures if API server becomes overloaded

- **Specific risks with polling architecture at scale**:
  - Thundering herd problem: all agents polling simultaneously
  - API server rate limiting may throttle or drop requests
  - Increased probability of incomplete data during high-load periods
  - Higher infrastructure costs due to over-provisioning to handle spikes

**Data for Visualization**:
- Cluster scale comparison: 1k pods (manageable), 10k pods (challenging), 20k pods (critical)
- API server load: Requests/second at different scales with polling vs streaming
- Metadata volume: Data size at 1k (2MB), 10k (20MB), 20k (40MB)
- Network bandwidth: Polling overhead at scale
- Failure scenarios: Impact of API server overload

### Current Architecture Problems

**Summary**: The current periodic polling architecture with large unary messages creates inefficiency, reliability issues, and poor scalability characteristics. Despite previous optimization attempts (separating metadata streams), the fundamental pattern remains problematic.

**Key Points**:
- **Message size problem**: 12MB messages exceed configured 10MB limit, causing failures
- **Resource waste**: Collecting 100% of data every 60s when 80-90% unchanged
- **Poor scalability**: Polling overhead scales linearly with cluster size and agent count
- **Memory spikes**: Large messages cause memory pressure on both agent and backend
- **Network inefficiency**: Repeated transmission of unchanged data
- **Missed events**: 60s polling interval means events can be delayed or missed if they occur and revert between polls

**Data for Visualization**:
- Problem metrics: 12MB actual > 10MB limit = failure
- Waste calculation: 80-90% of polled data is redundant/unchanged
- Response time: Events detected after 0-60s delay (average 30s)
- Comparison: Current problems vs proposed streaming solution

**Sources**: Internal system specifications from user's proposal

### Proposed Streaming Architecture

**Summary**: Transition from periodic polling to event-driven streaming using K8s Watch API and gRPC bidirectional streaming. Agents stream full state on startup, then only send incremental changes, dramatically reducing bandwidth, memory, and API server load.

**Key Points**:
- **Initial sync**: Agent connects, streams full K8s metadata state on startup
- **Ongoing operation**: Agent maintains K8s watch connection, forwards only changes (Add/Modify/Delete events)
- **Message size**: Individual events typically 1-10KB vs 12MB full snapshots
- **gRPC streaming**: Use bidirectional or server-side streaming for continuous event flow
- **Backpressure handling**: Stream allows flow control if backend processing falls behind
- **Reconnection strategy**: On disconnect, resync from last known resource version

**Benefits**:
- Reduces message sizes by 1000x (12MB → 1-10KB per event)
- Eliminates gRPC message size limit issues
- Reduces backend and agent memory usage by 90%+
- Reduces network bandwidth by 80-95% after initial sync
- Reduces API server load by 70-90%
- Near real-time event propagation (<1s latency vs 30s average)

**Data for Visualization**:
- Architecture comparison diagram: Polling (periodic full sync) vs Streaming (initial sync + deltas)
- Message flow: Polling sends 12MB every 60s vs Streaming sends 5KB events as they occur
- Bandwidth over time: Polling flat high usage vs Streaming spike then minimal
- Event latency: Polling 0-60s delay vs Streaming <1s

**Sources**: K8s API patterns, gRPC streaming best practices, user's proposal

### Architecture Trade-offs and Risks

**Summary**: While streaming architecture offers significant benefits, it requires substantial changes to current system design and introduces new complexity. Integration with existing services needs careful planning, and the team must adopt different operational patterns.

**Key Points**:
- **Trade-offs**:
  - ✅ Benefit: Dramatically better resource efficiency and scalability
  - ✅ Benefit: Real-time event propagation vs delayed polling
  - ❌ Cost: Significant development effort to redesign collection and processing
  - ❌ Cost: Changes core architectural pattern (departure from NKIA periodic collection model)
  - ❌ Cost: More complex connection management (handling reconnects, state synchronization)
  
- **Integration challenges**:
  - CM (Configuration Management) service: May expect periodic snapshots, needs adaptation for event stream
  - Alarm service: Needs to handle streaming events instead of periodic state checks
  - Events service: Potential overlap/conflict with K8s event streaming
  - Database/storage: May need schema changes to handle incremental updates efficiently
  
- **Operational complexity**:
  - Need robust reconnection logic with state reconciliation
  - Monitoring must track stream health, not just periodic job success
  - Debugging becomes more complex (stream state vs simple request/response)
  - Initial rollout requires careful migration strategy (can't switch all agents simultaneously)

- **Risk mitigation strategies**:
  - Implement hybrid mode: Support both polling (fallback) and streaming initially
  - Phased rollout: Test with small clusters first, then scale gradually
  - Comprehensive monitoring: Track stream health, event lag, missing updates
  - State reconciliation: Periodic full sync (e.g., every 24h) to catch missed events

**Data for Visualization**:
- Trade-off matrix: Polling vs Streaming across dimensions (efficiency, complexity, real-time, integration)
- Risk severity chart: Integration risks, operational risks, performance risks
- Migration timeline: Phased approach from current state to full streaming

**Sources**: System architecture analysis, integration requirements from user's proposal

## Notes and Considerations

### Challenges

- **Balancing honesty with persuasiveness**: Need to clearly present risks and complexity while still making a convincing case for the change
- **Technical depth vs accessibility**: Audience is technical but may not all have deep K8s or gRPC expertise
- **Data availability**: Some metrics are estimates based on research rather than internal measurements
- **Visualization complexity**: Comparing two architectures clearly without oversimplifying

### Assumptions

- Audience has basic understanding of gRPC, Kubernetes, and monitoring architectures
- Lotte deployment is mentioned as near-term driver, audience understands this context
- Team has capacity to undertake significant architectural work if convinced of benefits
- Current NKIA architecture pattern is known to audience

### Future Iterations

- Could add demo or live comparison if time permits
- Might include more detailed implementation timeline/roadmap
- Could expand on specific integration patterns for CM/Alarm/Events services
- May benefit from cost analysis (infrastructure costs saved)
- Could include customer/user impact analysis (better real-time monitoring)
